## The History of Pine Street School 
The Pine Street School was renovated in 1993 as a "Lasting Legacy" project of the Meridian Centennial Bureau. At the time of its initial renovation it stood at the corner of Pine and Meridian Streets. In 2008 it was relocated (not far) to where it presently sits, behind the Meridian Boys and Girls Club. Despite the slight move, The Pine Street School still resides near the intersection of Pine and Meridian Streets, right next to Meridian Elementary School. 

The Pine Street School, although not named that until 1993, was a one-room building built behind the Meridian Rural High School in 1920. In 1937, Meridian's elementary school district purchased the classroom and moved it near the old Meridian Grade School. For twelve years the building served as a second grade classroom and held music classes. In 1959, after the construction of a new elementary school nearby, the old elementary school was demolished. Once this happened, the schoolhouse became a school district maintenance and warehouse facility. It was not until 1993 when the Meridian Centennial Committee and the community worked to restore the edifice and renamed it The Pine Street School. Today it stands as a historic landmark that reminds Meridian residents of the city's devotion to both education and community, as schoolhouses often served as community meetings places.
